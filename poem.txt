Worth It
Laughter and screams of joy
Drying up tears from your cheek
Holding my hand when you´re coy
New adventures awaits every week

Conversations and an endless stream of WHY?
Trying to answer the questions in your heart
Why fish, why bird, why me, why bye?!
The hardest thing is definitely, to be apart.

Chest filled with joy and pride
Every time you learn something new
Your smile, so immensely wide
When you´ve figured out the clue.

How could I ever know
That life could be this great
And how fast you would grow
Although, you´re still lightweight

All I know is, you are worth it
My puzzle piece perfect fit
Every second of every day
you are my baby, YOU are my IT

for the rest of my life
I thank the earth, the sea and the stars above
For sending me my precious
my forever and ever love.
